# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
apples= 6
oranges= 2
total=( oranges + apples)
print(total)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
num1= 40
num2= 4
print(num1/num2)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
num1= 2
num2= 70
print(num1*num2)
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length= 170
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width =70
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area=(width*length)
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f"the result is {area}")
# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print(f"if the length of the rectangle is {length},and width is {width}, then the area is {area}")
